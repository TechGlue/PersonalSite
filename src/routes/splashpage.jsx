							Eastern Washington University Graduate, with a degree in Computer

						. Back in 2018, I entered my first Computer Science class with no technical background. That in my intro to programming class, installing and running a Python 'hello world' script seemed like an impossible task at the time. Despite the discomfort, I persevered, and it has changed my life for the better. It required a lot of trial and error, assistance from my peers, and countless hours spent in the lab programming in my free time. I Eventually, managed to graduate with my bachelor's degree and secure my first full-time Software Engineering position in the Fall of 2022.
