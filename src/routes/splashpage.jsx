            I'm a Washington based Software Engineer. Who mostly works with C#
            at work but has a strong passion and curiosity for other
            technologies that changes the way I approach problems and overall
            pushes me to get out of my shell.

          <p>
            I'm a <b>Eastern Washington University Computer Science Graduate </b>, who back in 2018 was
            entering their first Computer Science class, and as a person with no
            technical background, I felt way over my head. Luckily, I stuck
            through it and has changed my life for the better. Through alot of
            trial and error, help from my peers, and many hours of coding in my
            free time on anything big or small. I ended up graduating and
            starting my first Software Engineering position at{" "}
            <b>Premera Blue Cross</b> in the Fall of 2023.

            Looking back, it feels like it's been a long time since I started my
            journey, but I really grew to appreciate all the struggles that it
            took to get here. Right now, my main goal is to grow as a developer
            by continuing to push myself to learn new things and hopefully help
            others along the way.
