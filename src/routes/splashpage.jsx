            I'm a Washington based Software Engineer, who mostly works with C#
            at work but has a strong passion and curiosity for other
            technologies that changes the way I approach problems and overall
            pushes me to get out of my shell.

              Eastern Washington University Graduate, with a degree in Computer
              Science
            </b>
            . Back in 2018, I was entering my first Computer Science class with
            no technical background, and I felt completely out of my depth.
            Fortunately, I persevered, and it has changed my life for the
            better. Through a lot of trial and error, assistance from my peers,
            and countless hours of coding in my free time, tackling projects big
            and small, I managed to graduate and secure my first full-time
            Software Engineering position at <b>Premera Blue Cross</b> in the
            Fall of 2023.

            Reflecting back at the last couple of years of my undergrad in my
            head it feels like it's time for a breather right you got over that
            hump of getting a degree??? But nah I really grew to appreciate all
            the struggles that it took to get something done so I want to
            continue that marathon.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Right now, my main goal is to grow as a person by continuing to push
            myself to learn new languages and frameworks. Additionally, I aim to
            regain my physical fitness through strength and weight training.
            Hopefully, I can find that elusive balance in this ever-changing
            world.
