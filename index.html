      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class = "text">Hi, my name is Luís Garcia and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Eastern Washington University. I've been coding for about a year and a half now. It's been a great experience exploring everything that CS offers. I have hopes of being a Full-Stack Developer once I graduate. At the moment, I'm putting in my extra time to learning web development and iOS app development. My goal for 2021 is to secure a full-time Software Engineering Internship. <br>Thank you, for visiting my page feel free to check out some of my work!.</p>

        <h3>How I got started.</h3>
        <p>Coming up as a first generation American I didn't have much exposure to code growing up. I found my love for code by solving common tech problems that I had. Going into my senior year of high school my Science teacher introduced me to Computer Science as a career path after highschool. At first
          I was skeptical about it since I never heard about it and I had the stigma that it was for those who exceled at school. I decided to try it out because it had two of my favorite things in it tech and solving problems.
          Ever since then, I've been hooked learning new technologies and tools!

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>As most people my Life isn't all code. I like to skateboard whenever the weather is right. I'm an active sneaker head with a small collection of
          primarily Jordans and Nikes. Lastly, I love to tinker with tech whether it's fixing up my at home desktop, playing around with a Raspberry Pie,
          soldering and building mechanical keyboards. Playing around with hardware is one of my favorite way of passing time. </p>
