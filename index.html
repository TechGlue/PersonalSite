    <p id="intro" class="font-semibold text-2xl">Hi, Iâ€™m a fourth-year Computer Science student at Eastern Washington
      University. Looking for a Summer 2022 Internship and/or a fall Co-op.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg">Iâ€™ve been programming for about 2 and a half years now. Itâ€™s been a great experience exploring
      everything that the CS field has to offer.Â </p>
    <br>
    <p class="font-semibold text-2xl mb-2">What made me interested in the field?Â </p>
    <p id="expandingintro" class="text-lg">I did not have much access to development tools or an idea of how programs
      worked. Originally
      I thought programs that run on computers and smartphones were things of magic that took the top minds in the world
      to create such a thing. Come my senior year of high school my school finally implemented a Computer Science type
      course where they had us programming in Scratch which is a drag and drop style of programming. While I did not
      like the idea of dragging and dropping elements. I did enjoy the satisfaction of having a working program. Even if
      itâ€™s something as simple as having a sprite move back and forth from the screen itâ€™s something.Â </p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg">When it came time to pick a major come my first day at Eastern Washington University It was a
      no-brainer that Computer Science would be the field for me. Ever since then Iâ€™ve been playing the catch-up game by
      learning front-end development, back-end development, Linux, and much more!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold">My goal come graduation is to find employment as a software engineer in the
      Spokane, WA area if possible. But, as I know the CS field is a rapidly growing industry with so many options. Iâ€™m
      very much interested in exploring different fields and locations.Â </p>
    <br>
    <p class="font-semibold text-2xl mb-2">What I like to do in my free time</p>
    <ul class="list-decima">
      <div id="list-items" class="ml-8 text-lg">
        <li>Iâ€™m an active sneakerhead. With a small collection of primarily Jordans and Nikes.Â </li>
        <li>I enjoy tinkering with hardware. Love building mechanical keyboards from scratch.Â </li>
        <li>As well as learning new technologies for the fun of it. Always working towards a better me is something I
          strive for every day!</li>
