      'CheckMeIn is a personal .NET core project that I created to learn more about .NET Core, uncommon C# libraries and Azure. The project is simple in nature, as it is a check-in system for a variety of habits that I want to track for positive reinforcement. The project is hosted on Azure App Service, deployed through Github Actions, and uses Azure SQL for data storage. This is a sandbox project that will be continuously updated as I pick up new skills.
