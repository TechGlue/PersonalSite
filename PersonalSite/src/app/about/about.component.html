Hi! Iâ€™m Luis, a software engineer based in Washington. I enjoy building software that solves real-world problems. While my primary focus is back-end development, I also love exploring my creative side by building front-end applications.

  A bit about my background, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Eastern Washington University. I have been writing software professionally for 2 years working primarily in .NET on various projects ranging from backend business applications, developer tools, and desktop applications.
