      I have been writing software professionally for 2 years working primarily
      in .NET on projects ranging from backend business applications, developer
      tools, and legacy Windows desktop apps. Where now I've transitioned to a
      data related role working with SQL, Power BI, and Python. Exploring
      everything this field has to offer all the while enjoying the journey.
