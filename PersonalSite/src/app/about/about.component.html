      I have been writing software professionally for a while now working
      primarily in .NET on projects ranging from backend business applications,
      developer tools, and legacy Windows desktop apps. Where now I've
      transitioned to a data related role working with SQL, Power BI, and
      Python. Exploring everything this field has to offer all the while
      enjoying the journey.
