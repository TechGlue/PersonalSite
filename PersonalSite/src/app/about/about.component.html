    <p class="">
      I have been writing software professionally for a while now initially
      starting my journey as a Software Engineer working in .NET writing C#.
      Now, I specialize in building automated, and resilient ETL systems using
      tools like Microsoft Fabric, Notebooks, Azure Devop Pipelines, and Power
      BI, with a strong emphasis in infrastructure as code and long-term
      maintainability.
