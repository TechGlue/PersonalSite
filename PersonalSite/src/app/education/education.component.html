      <p>
        I've worked with various languages and tools throughout my journey as a
        student and a developer. There often times where I learn a language for
        a one-off project, coursework, or was influenced by hype to pick up a
        new language. But these are the ones that I've enjoyed and continue to
        use today both personally and professionally.

          Software Developer I, Mountlake Terrace, WA [JAN. 2023 - AUG. 2024]
        </p>
        <p>
          Premera Blue Cross is a prominent blue cross blue shield insurance
          company in the Pacific Northwest. As a full time developer, I got the
          opportunity to work on business changes to back-end applications that
          fulfilled crucial functions for the business, build developer tools to
          streamline and standardized code deployments, and develop internal
          desktop applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further responsibilities included designing, writing documentation,
          collaborating with the business and various teams at Premera, and
          driving the daily developer standup.

        <p>
          My initial introduction to writing professional code and working in a
          team environment came during my internship at Premera. I gained
          experience in various areas, including shadowing developers and
          learning how they design and deliver code to make healthcare work
          better for the customer. I also learned about the insurance business
          and frequently collaborated with internal Premera business analysts
          while following Agile practices. By the end of the summer, I
          successfully delivered a full-stack internal web application for
          parsing enrollment files and generating reports for the business to
          leverage.
